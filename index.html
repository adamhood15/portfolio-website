                        Hey there! My name is Adam Hood and I am a Full Stack Web Developer. I am currently
                        a student at Rice University's Full Stack Coding Bootcamp and will be
                        earning my certificate at the beginning of August 2023. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        My passion for web development started
                        in the Summer of 2022 when I decided to make my own video game. I jumped head first
                        into learning C# and after a full summer of learning I decided I wanted to switch careers
                        from teaching and go full time into web development.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I'm experienced in HTML, CSS, C#, and JavaScript. I've also built multiple full stack web
                        applications incorporating Node.js, MySQL, Sequelize, and building those applications using 
                        a Model View Controller architecture. I am an excellent communicator,
                        an extremely hard worker, and am eager to learn everything I can about web development. 
                        Come and take a look at all the great work I've done!

                            a random movie based on the genre and time the user selects. It also generates a list of streaming
                            apps that you can watch your movie selection on.

                                as this was my first full stack application with this much functionality but I am very proud of the work that I did.
